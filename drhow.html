                                    A slot and estimated time will be assigned to an Elective appointment only when the
                                    appointment is registered after the appointment is made. Elective appointments will
                                    be arranged to be after all Priority appointments.

                                    before its registration. During calculation of slot sequnce and appointments'
                                    estiamted times, an unregistered Premier appointment will be taken into account
                                    although it's not being registered yet. Therefore, when a Premier appointment is
                                    being registered, it will be slotted ahead of Elective appontments when determining
                                    estimated time.
